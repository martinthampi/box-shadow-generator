## Inspiration

I spend much time changing the X and Y of the box-shadow to fit my need. I spend time on transparency and other kinds of stuff. So, as a solution to this problem, I decided to code a box-shadow generator. 

**Another thing is that the commonly used box-shadow generator developed by [cssmatic.com](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) has recently shut down and the need keeps on rising. So, introducing mine.**

I also found some alternatives but they're really worse*. They do the job but are of very bad UI and user experience. I could not use such sites to meet my need.

git clone https://github.com/martinthampi/box-shadow-generator.git
